                        <p>8.1A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent
                            by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent
                            back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>



                        <p>8.2Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will
                            be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted
                            by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the
                            end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>



                        <p>8.3Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but
                            personal data that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and
